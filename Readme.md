Imp
===

Imp is a command-line Arduino toolkit which aims to provide low-level control.

It facilitates the use of easy-to-read makefiles of the kind one would typically find in a pure C project.

It can compile the Arduino core and its third party libraries into linkable archives (think `-larduino -lethernet`)
