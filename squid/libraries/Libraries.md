Imp | Libraries
===============

The GenericLibrary makefile should be able to compile most libraries.

Any library that can't be compiled with the generic makefile can use a custom makefile from here instead.

Please help expand the selection of "compilable" libraries by submitting makefiles and testing the generic makefile.

You can also add makefiles for your own custom libraries.

Makefiles should be named the same as their library folder, with a .mk extension.
